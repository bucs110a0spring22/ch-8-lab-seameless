## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
Vowels is causing an assertion error, but I don't understand why; 'interesting' is correctly showing 4, but still causes the exit. I presume it may be due to an issue with the iteration, but I don't know for sure and was not able to get any word on the reason from TAs/professor. The other code I believe is in shape to be functional.

## REFERENCES:
None

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I do not understand why the code is exiting given the code is showing the correct output in vowels for 'interesting', so I don't know how this should be approached. Please feel free to reach out with any information on this.
